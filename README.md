# Introduction
Foresight Pharmaceuticals is one of the leading Pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies with a global presence. Their markets are divided into different regions across the world. One of those regions manages the Germany and Poland Markets. The simulated sales data for this company shows a need for strategic realignment to address current market challenges and leverage growth opportunities. This report delves into this data to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

# Problem Statement
Foresight Pharmaceuticals has observed a 9.2% decrease in sales year-over-year. This downward trend has manifested across various sales teams and product lines, suggesting systemic issues that warrant a thorough analysis. The company must identify the underlying causes of this decline and formulate a comprehensive strategy to improve sales performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and regain market dominance.

# Data Insights
- **Decrease in Overall Sales**: There's a 9.2% decrease in sales compared to the previous year (PY).

- **Product Class & Sales Team Performance**: The 'Delta' team is leading in sales figures across most product classes. However, there's room for improvement as the sales numbers are still below the previous year's.

- **Sales by Product Name & Sales Team**: Certain products like 'Tetratanyl' and 'Acycranfine Microvate' have high sales in some teams but low in others, indicating potential market or team-specific issues.

- **Sales by Country**: The visualization suggests a concentration of sales in Germany which indicates a strong market presence in that region.

- **Sales by Channel**: There's a decrease in sales in both Pharmacy and Hospital channels, with Pharmacy experiencing a lesser decrease.

- **Sales by Sub-Channel**: The Retail sub-channel is the least affected by the sales decrease, suggesting resilience or effectiveness in that channel.

- **Customer and Distributor Dynamics**: 'Parker, Green and Emmerich Pharma Plc' and 'Koss' are the leading customers and distributors, respectively. However, there's a notable decrease in sales with Koss distributors. There's also a remarkable 94% increase in sales by Erdman distributors compared to the previous year.

# Recommendations
- **Investigate and Address Sales Decline**: Conduct market research to understand the reasons behind the sales decline. This could be due to external market conditions, increased competition, or internal issues such as product pricing or sales strategy.

- **Boost Underperforming Teams and Products**: Provide additional training and resources to the 'Bravo' and 'Alfa' teams. Explore why certain products are underperforming in certain teams and address these issues.

- **Optimize Sales Channels**: Since the Retail sub-channel is performing relatively well, consider reallocating marketing resources to bolster the Retail channel while investigating the reasons behind the decline in other channels.

- **Customer Retention and Growth**: Develop targeted marketing campaigns to retain top customers and distributors, and identify potential new partnerships based on the performance data.

- **Regional Marketing Strategies**: Consider replicating the successful strategies in Germany for the Poland market.

- **Product-Specific Marketing**: Some products like 'Tetratanyl' and 'Acycranfine Microvate' are performing well in certain teams but not in others. Tailor marketing strategies to the strengths of each sales team and the unique selling propositions of these products.

- **Performance Analysis**: Carry out a deeper analysis of the 'Delta' team to understand what they are doing differently and potentially replicate their strategies across other teams.

- **Distributor Relations**: With Koss distributor showing a decrease in sales, it's crucial to engage with them to understand any challenges and improve the partnership.

- **Adjust Marketing Spend**: Given the current downward trend in sales, it might be wise to reassess and optimize the allocation of the marketing budget to focus on high-impact activities and channels.
